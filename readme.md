# sdl via luajit

- LuaJIT 2D Game Development <https://chatgpt.com/share/470cd945-7e27-42bd-8aff-e6ab84b2ead4> .
- edited with VSCode and Sublime Text .
- running in Ubuntu and Windows . Windows required me MSYS and MinGW for LuaJIT and libSDL2.
- install both LuaJIT and SDL , in PATH , so they can be found , and can be used .
- write me for feedback including doubts and issues , as well as kudos and encouragements .
- this is small but could grow . a good news is that you can participate to it even with comments .
- fork this github repository and try experimenting . we can co-assist our-selves in such explorations .
- above all enjoy and keep a positive life outlook . no stress . just love and fun .
